#### Key Points I Found Interesting:
- Marcos noted patients in need of kidney transplants are now covered by PhilHealth for the medical expenses
- Marcos noted the frustration over poor government services
- Marcos noted that flood control projects are ineffective and criticizes those who had profited through kickbacks

#### Key Points I Found Weird:
- Marcos promised to provide ALL public school teachers with free laptops 
- Marcos promised that the Philippine Sports comission will open a track in feild oval in cities such as Pasig & Manila. 

After the events of the 2025 SONA, it highlighted the key issues in categories such as Health Services, Education & Agriculutre. Things Marcos promised he would provide such as compensatiing for overworked teachers, which helps solve the issues of overworked & understaffed schools. He also promised to launch a 20 peso per kilo rice prohram that warns traders against price manipulation, which helped the growing problem with inflation prices. Marcos continued to promise multiple things to help "improve" the livelihood of the Filipinos. 

Although Marcos promised so many things for an imporvement of like for the Filipinos, are we so sure that these arent just empty promises? Considering the toll this would take especially since the costs of keeping these promises would take a big toll on the government's funds, this could cause multiple "promises" getting trashed or neglected by the government. Although there are many ways in which they could still maintain these many promises, it would be difficult to resolve them all considering the number of concurrent issues we still face and having to pick which one to prioritize over the other. Overall, I would say there is hope for the Philippines after the proposal of these projects, would it help the Filipino - yes it would, but are we sure that these promises will go through - not exactly. 

#### Message for the Philippines:
"There's still hope !!"``
